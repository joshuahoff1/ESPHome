### E-Ink Dashboard


This is a dashboard for displaying weather information and more on an E-Ink display. It uses ESPHome and can be modified to display different pieces of information.   Currently, the weather is displayed on the left-hand side, and the right-hand side displays a calendar and current music playing info

The dashboard is designed to be used with the [XIAO 7.5-inch ePaper Panel](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-7-5-ePaper-Panel-p-6416.html) in landscape, though should work with any project using the Waveshare 7.5-inch E-Ink display.
